# Network Module

Defines foundational networking resources:

- VPC with configurable CIDR
- Public/private subnets across two AZs
- NAT Gateway and route tables
- Security groups for ALB, ECS services, RDS, and Redis

Implement module resources in `main.tf` alongside input/output variables once ready.
